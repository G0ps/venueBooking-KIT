Nice â€” fresh start, I love it. ðŸŽ¯
Below youâ€™ll find a **complete 30-day plan** split into **3 phases (10 days each)** â€” each phase ends with a clear **MVP** â€” plus a full **spec document** covering features you asked for (venues + amenities, LLM decision-assistant, worker category, multiple-venue booking, industry best practices, scalability, security, testing, deployment, APIs, DB schema, UI flows, prompts, and acceptance criteria).

# Summary (one-liner)

Build a MERN-based Venues & Amenities Booking System with worker management and an LLM-assisted manager decision layer â€” delivered as three incremental 10-day MVP phases over 30 days.

---

# 30-Day Timeline (day-by-day, Phase 1â†’3)

Each day entry gives tasks and a short deliverable. Assume one full-time developer + part-time designer; adjust if team differs.

## Phase 1 â€” Core platform + single-venue booking MVP (Days 1â€“10)

**Goal:** Working web app where students can register/login, view venues & amenities, book a single venue+amenities slot, basic worker records, admin panel to approve bookings, and a minimal LLM assistant (read-only suggestions).

**Day 1 â€” Project setup & backlog**

* Initialize repo, branch strategy (main/dev/feature/\*).
* Create project skeleton: monorepo or separate services (frontend React app, backend Node/Express, MongoDB).
* Create issue backlog & wireframes for core flows (booking, admin).
  **Deliverable:** Repo + issues + initial wireframes.

**Day 2 â€” Auth + User model**

* Implement JWT-based auth (register/login/refresh).
* Roles: student/user, manager, worker, admin.
  **Deliverable:** Auth endpoints + Postman collection + basic login UI.

**Day 3 â€” Venue & Amenity models + CRUD**

* DB collections: venues, amenities.
* Admin UI to create/manage venues & amenities.
  **Deliverable:** CRUD APIs + UI list/create forms.

**Day 4 â€” Booking model & single-venue booking flow**

* Booking API: create booking (single venue), list bookings, cancel.
* Frontend booking UI (select venue, date/time slot, pick amenities).
  **Deliverable:** Booking flow working end-to-end.

**Day 5 â€” Worker model + basic assignment**

* Worker categories (cleaner, electrician, security, verifier), availability model.
* Admin can assign a worker to a booking.
  **Deliverable:** Worker CRUD + assignment UI.

**Day 6 â€” Prevent double-booking & basic concurrency**

* Implement slot locking / atomic check using MongoDB transactions or optimistic locking (booking.status).
* Add server-side validation to reject conflicts.
  **Deliverable:** Safe single-venue booking under concurrent requests.

**Day 7 â€” Admin approval workflows**

* Booking statuses: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, CANCELLED.
* Manager can approve/reject; notification stub (email queued).
  **Deliverable:** Approval panel.

**Day 8 â€” Minimal LLM integration (read-only suggestions)**

* Integrate an LLM *client* that accepts booking context and returns suggestions (e.g., recommend workers, highlight conflicts, suggest alternative time slots). **Manager must still approve**.
* Provide prompt templates and endpoint to fetch suggestion. (LLM kept as assistant â€” no auto-approve.)
  **Deliverable:** LLM suggestion UI for manager.

**Day 9 â€” Frontend polish + validations**

* UX for booking calendar/slot picker, amenity selection, worker info.
* Add input validations and error handling.
  **Deliverable:** Usable UI.

**Day 10 â€” Testing & MVP1 acceptance**

* End-to-end tests for booking flow, unit tests for critical server functions, run security checklist.
  **MVP1 Acceptance Criteria:** Register/login, view venues, book a single venue + amenities, manager approve/reject, worker assignment, LLM suggestions available (read-only), concurrency safeguards.

---

## Phase 2 â€” Amenity-only booking, multi-venue events, worker verification (Days 11â€“20)

**Goal:** Users can book only amenities (without venue), support multi-venue single-event bookings, on-site worker verification flows, notifications, and deeper LLM capabilities (recommendations + pre-populated decision notes).

**Day 11 â€” Amenity-only booking**

* Booking type: AMENITY\_ONLY (no venue).
* UI to select one or multiple amenities and duration.
  **Deliverable:** Amenity-only flows and APIs.

**Day 12 â€” Event entity & multi-venue booking**

* Introduce `Event` collection linking multiple venue bookings into a single event.
* Create UI to build an event that reserves multiple venues/amenities in one transaction.
  **Deliverable:** Multi-venue reservation flow with atomic commit/rollback.

**Day 13 â€” Worker scheduling & shift generation**

* Auto-generate worker shifts per booking/event, allow staff to accept shifts.
  **Deliverable:** Worker schedule generator + worker acceptance endpoint.

**Day 14 â€” On-site verification & checklists**

* Worker verification checklist (cleaning completed, equipment functional, security signoff).
* QR code-based verification URL for worker on mobile; manager can view verification status.
  **Deliverable:** Verification UI + QR token generator.

**Day 15 â€” LLM decision support v2**

* Expand LLM: given an event with multiple venues/amenities, LLM suggests staffing levels, risks (e.g., overlapping cleaning windows), and a manager note draft.
* Implement human-in-the-loop interface where manager edits AI draft and saves as decision log.
  **Deliverable:** LLM-driven draft decisions + edit/save.

**Day 16 â€” Notifications (email + push stub)**

* Implement transactional email for bookings, worker shift notifications, manager alerts. Add WebSocket (Socket.io) for realtime updates.
  **Deliverable:** Notification flows + socket events.

**Day 17 â€” Payment & billing (optional minimal)**

* If needed, integrate mock payment flow (or campus billing) for paid amenities. Record invoices, payment status.
  **Deliverable:** Payment API stub + invoice model.

* Log every booking action, LLM suggestion used/ignored, worker verification. Provide admin audit UI.
  **Deliverable:** Audit logs + feed.

**Day 19 â€” Security review & role hardening**

* Enforce RBAC, input sanitation, rate limits, CORS rules, secrets vault, environment config.
  **Deliverable:** Security checklist completed.

**Day 20 â€” Testing & MVP2 acceptance**
**MVP2 Acceptance Criteria:** Amenity-only booking, multi-venue booking (events), worker scheduling & on-site verification, notifications, LLM-assisted decision drafting, payment stub/invoice.

---

## Phase 3 â€” LLM automation & optimizations, analytics, production hardening (Days 21â€“30)

**Goal:** Add advanced LLM features (smart auto-suggestions with confidence thresholds), analytics/dashboard, monitoring, CI/CD, and production deployment.

**Day 21 â€” Advanced LLM: ranking & confidence**

* LLM returns structured suggestions with confidence scores and reasoning. Build policy for auto-suggest vs manual.
  **Deliverable:** Structured LLM response format & UI showing confidence.

**Day 22 â€” Auto-scheduling assistant**

* LLM suggests full staffing plan for an Event; if confidence > threshold and manager allows auto-apply, the system can auto-assign workers (but with human override).
  **Deliverable:** Auto-apply flow w/ audit trail.

**Day 23 â€” Dashboard & analytics**

* Admin dashboard: bookings per week, worker utilization, venue utilization heatmap, upcoming events.
  **Deliverable:** Basic analytics screens + summary reports.

**Day 24 â€” Performance & DB scaling**

* Add indices, shard/replica recommendations, caching (Redis) for hot reads (venue list, calendar). Optimize queries.
  **Deliverable:** Performance tuning changes.

**Day 25 â€” CI/CD pipeline & infra**

* Pipelines for test â†’ staging â†’ production. IaC scripts (Terraform or platform-specific). Containerize (Docker), add Kubernetes/Cloud Run plan.
  **Deliverable:** CI pipeline + deployment scripts.

## Data model (MongoDB collections â€” example fields)

(Indexes key fields like `venue._id`, `booking.eventId`, `booking.timeSlots.start`, `user.role`)

{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "role": "student|manager|admin|worker",
  "passwordHash": "string",
  "phone": "string",
  "profile": {...},
  "createdAt": "Date"
}
```

### Venues

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "name": "Auditorium A",
  "location": "Block 3, Floor 1",
  "capacity": 200,
  "amenities": ["proj-1","mics-2"],

}
```

## API design (representative endpoints)

Use REST with proper status codes. Provide idempotency keys for booking creation.

* `POST /api/auth/register`
* `POST /api/auth/login`
* `GET /api/venues` â€” filters, availability query parameters
* `POST /api/venues` (admin)
* `GET /api/amenities`
* `POST /api/bookings` â€” create booking (idempotency-key header)

  * payload includes `type`, `venueId` or amenity list, `start`, `end`, `eventId?`
* `POST /api/events` â€” create multi-venue event
* `GET /api/bookings/:id`
* `POST /api/bookings/:id/cancel`
* `POST /api/bookings/:id/assign-worker` (manager/admin)
* `POST /api/llm/suggest` â€” server-side endpoint that calls the LLM with booking/event context and returns structured suggestions (only accessible to managers/admin)
* `POST /api/workers/:id/accept-shift`
* `POST /api/verify/:bookingId` â€” QR link payload; worker updates verification checklist
* `GET /api/dashboard/usage` â€” analytics (admin)

**Security:** All endpoints require JWT except public venue list. Role checks enforced server-side.

---

## Concurrency & correctness

* **Single-venue slot model**: define canonical time slots (e.g., 30/60/120 mins) or allow arbitrary start/end but check overlaps.
* Use MongoDB **transactions (sessions)** when creating bookings that affect inventory or multiple documents (multi-venue event): create booking docs + decrement amenity inventory + write audit in same transaction.
* **Idempotency Key**: client must send idempotency-key for booking creation to avoid duplicate bookings on retries.
* **Optimistic locking**: document `version` field; reject or re-evaluate if version mismatch.
* **Queue for worker assignment**: if heavy scheduling, use a job queue (BullMQ) to avoid race conditions.

---

## LLM integration (detailed)

**Purpose:** Reduce manager decision pressure by summarizing risks, proposing staffing, suggesting alternative dates/times, drafting approval notes, and auto-scheduling when safe.

**Where to call LLM:** Server-side only (backend), never expose API keys. Cache LLM output for repeatability and audit.

**Input context for LLM:**

* Booking/Event details: venues, capacities, start/end times, amenities list, historic utilization data (opt), worker availability, budget constraints, policy rules (noise restrictions), special flags (VIP).
* Last 5 similar events (optional) for reference.

**Desired structured response (JSON)**

```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "id": "s1",
      "type":"staffing",
      "workers": [{"category":"cleaner","count":3},{"category":"security","count":2}],
      "confidence": 0.87,
      "rationale":"Large crowd expected, two back-to-back booking windows..."
    }
  ],
  "risks": [
    {"code":"OVERLAP_AMENITY","message":"Required projector quantity exceeds inventory", "severity":"high"}
  ],
  "draftManagerNote": "Suggested text for manager review..."
}
```

**Prompt templates (server maintains)**:

* Provide concrete templates with system and user messages; include policy such as "Do not return PII, return JSON only". Log prompt and response.

**Policy & safety:**

* LLM should **not** auto-approve unless configured and manager has explicitly enabled auto-apply with confidence thresholds.
* Store LLM responses, prompt, and managerâ€™s final action in AuditLog.
* Provide a confidence threshold (e.g., 0.9) for auto-apply; otherwise require manager sign-off.

**Human-in-loop flow:**

1. Manager requests suggestion for booking/event.
2. LLM returns structured suggestion + confidence.
3. Manager can Accept (apply), Modify (edit draft), or Reject.
4. System logs choice and optionally triggers assignments/notifications.

---

## UI / UX flows (key screens)

* Venue catalogue + search + filter (capacity, location, amenities).
* Calendar view with available slots (per-venue).
* Booking wizard: choose venue(s), choose amenities, set times, preview cost, submit for approval.
* Event builder for multi-venue bookings (drag & drop), conflict detection.
* Manager dashboard with LLM suggestions panel, booking approvals queue, audit feed.
* Worker mobile verification view (checklist + attach photos + signature).
* Notifications center with booking updates.

---

## Worker verification best practices

* Use QR code linking to a secure verification URL with a one-time token and time-limited validity.
* Worker fills checklist, attaches optional photo proof, signs off.
* Manager can re-open verification if issues found.
* Store verification hashes + photos in secure object store with access controls.

---

## Testing strategy

* Unit tests for all business logic (booking conflict checks, worker assignment).
* Integration tests for booking and transaction flows (simulate concurrent bookings).
* End-to-end tests for UI flows (Cypress / Playwright).
* LLM integration tests use deterministic prompts and mocked LLM to verify parsing and safety constraints.
* Load testing for booking hotspot scenarios (JMeter / k6).

---

## Production & DevOps

* **CI:** Run lint, unit tests, integration tests, build.
* **CD:** Staging on merge to `main`, manual promotion to prod.
* **Secrets:** Use vault manager (AWS Secrets Manager / GCP Secret Manager).
* **Backups:** Daily DB backups, point-in-time for DB as needed.
* **Rollback:** Blue/green or canary deploy options.
* **Monitoring:** Track booking success rate, LLM latency, worker acceptance rate.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (per phase recap)

* **MVP1:** Basic booking/approval/worker assignment + LLM suggestions (read-only), concurrency safe.
* **MVP2:** Amenity-only bookings, multi-venue events, worker scheduling & verification, notification flows.
* **MVP3:** Advanced LLM structured suggestions + auto-apply policy, analytics, CI/CD, monitoring, production-ready deployment.

---

## Future ideas / industry-expected extras (post-30 days)

* Calendar sync (Google Calendar / Outlook).
* Mobile app for workers (accept shifts, verify).
* Integrations with campus SSO & payment gateways.
* Smart pricing (dynamic rates depending on demand).
* Predictive staffing (use historical data to train small models for staffing forecasts).
* SLA rules & escalation policies for no-shows or failed verification.

---

# Risks & Mitigations

* **Double-booking risk** â€” mitigate with DB transactions, idempotency keys, locks.
* **LLM hallucinations** â€” return structured JSON only, include confidence, require human approval for important actions.
* **PII leaks** â€” minimize PII in prompts, store minimal user identifiable info with access controls.
* **Worker no-show** â€” maintain backup pool & auto-notify replacements.

---

# Final notes & next steps (immediate)

* If you want, I can:

  * Export this spec to a markdown or a checklist file.
  * Generate the DB schemas as Mongoose models.
  * Draft the LLM prompt templates and the JSON schema for responses.
  * Create Postman collection / sample Postgres? (we're using MongoDB)
    Pick one and Iâ€™ll produce it next â€” I wonâ€™t ask for confirmation; Iâ€™ll just generate what you choose. Which of the above would you like me to produce right now?
